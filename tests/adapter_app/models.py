"""Models for the adapter_app tests.

Rows a Presenter reads by attribute rather than dataclass instances, so the
adapter is shown rendering what a selector actually returns: a foreign key
that is a row, a reverse relation that is a manager, a decimal column, and a
choice column that holds a plain ``str``.
