class SpecFormView(TemplateResponseMixin, ContextMixin, View):
    """A ``ServiceSpec`` validated by a form, served as the page a person fills that form in on.

    The spec's Validator must be a
    [`FormValidator`][django_service_specs.adapters.forms.form_validator.FormValidator],
    and its form class is the page's form:

        urlpatterns = [
            path(
                "books/new/",
                SpecFormView.as_view(
                    spec=add_book_spec,
                    template_name="books/book_form.html",
                    success_url=reverse_lazy("books"),
                ),
            ),
        ]

    **GET** renders ``template_name`` with an unbound form under ``form``,
    beside ``view`` and ``spec``: the names Django's ``FormView`` uses, with
    ``extra_context`` merged in as Django's ``ContextMixin`` does. The spec's
    class-level permission check runs first, through
    [`authorize`][django_service_specs.authorization.authorize.authorize], so
    a page is never offered to a principal the post would refuse. The form is
    always unbound: showing an update's current row as its initial data is a
    page of its own, which this view does not build.

    **POST runs that check first too**, before the post is read. A refused
    post is answered with the page again, and dispatch's shape check comes
    before its own permission check, so without it a principal the spec
    refuses would be shown the page - every row a choice field lists, and
    ``extra_context`` - by posting a malformed form. The
    [`Grant`][django_service_specs.authorization.grant.Grant] it returns goes
    to dispatch, so the class-level check runs once; the object-level check
    is still dispatch's, on the row it resolves.

    **POST** binds the form to the post and reads the arguments through its
    own widgets - a checkbox is ``True`` or ``False``, a multi-select a list -
    because that is how Django reads a form, and a flat reading refuses a
    checkbox's ``"on"``. Only the form's fields are read, so the CSRF token
    and a named submit button never become arguments, and a disabled field is
    not read at all, as the form ignores what is posted for it. A field left
    blank is absent, as it is to the form. A number, date or date-time the
    field reads in one of its input formats - ``10/25/2006``, a localized
    ``12,50`` - is sent on in the form the shape check reads, through the
    field's own ``to_python``, so the shape check never refuses what the form
    accepts. The URL kwargs are merged last, so the route wins a clash, as in
    [`request_arguments`][django_service_specs.http.request_arguments.request_arguments].
    Each is an argument, so the spec declares each one: a kwarg it does not is
    the host's misconfiguration, raised as ``ImproperlyConfigured`` under
    either ``unknown_arguments`` policy rather than answered as a refused post.
    Then [`dispatch`][django_service_specs.dispatch.dispatch.dispatch]:

    - **A success** redirects to ``get_success_url(result)``: ``success_url``
      through Django's ``resolve_url`` by default, so a ``reverse_lazy`` or a
      URL name works, and a subclass overrides it to read the result.
    - **A refusal of the arguments** - ``InvalidArguments``, or a
      ``ServiceValidationError`` - re-renders the bound form at 400 with the
      refusal placed on it by
      [`add_argument_errors`][django_service_specs.http.add_argument_errors.add_argument_errors].
      A service's string or list detail is about the whole form.
    - **Any other refusal** re-renders it with the message as a non-field
      error: ``ServiceConflict`` at 409, any other ``ServiceError`` at 422, any
      other ``DispatchError`` at 400. The statuses are ``error_response``'s, so
      a client reading a refused post - htmx, or Turbo, which will not render
      a failed post answered 200 - reads it the same way.
    - ``NotPermitted`` and ``PrincipalUnavailable`` raise Django's
      ``PermissionDenied``, and a not-found result or ``ServiceNotFound``
      raises ``Http404``, for the host's own 403 and 404 pages.

    **A re-rendered form carries the refusal and nothing else**: the page says
    what dispatch decided. The page's own form is bound to no row, so its own
    errors are not shown: its uniqueness check would tell an update page that
    an unchanged unique value was taken. After a shape-check refusal, then,
    the form's further checks - a length, ``clean()``, uniqueness - answer the
    next post rather than this one.

    ``as_view()`` refuses, when the URLconf is imported, a view with no
    ``ServiceSpec``, a spec whose Validator is not a ``FormValidator``, and a
    view with no ``success_url`` that does not override ``get_success_url``.

    **Sync only**, in this release. **CSRF is the host's middleware**, as for
    any Django view, and the template renders ``{% csrf_token %}``.

    Attributes:
        spec: The operation served. Required.
        template_name: The page's template, as for any Django template view.
        success_url: Where a successful post redirects, read by
