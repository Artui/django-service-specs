    """The arguments a request carries for ``parameters``, typed as a JSON caller would send them.

    Where they are read from depends on the method and the body:

    - **GET and HEAD**: the query string, which is flat. Any body is ignored.
    - **Any other method, with an** ``application/json`` **body**: the body,
      read as it is. It must be a JSON object; an empty body is no arguments,
      as DRF's parser reads one. Its values are not coerced: a JSON caller
      that sends ``"5"`` for an integer has sent a string, and the shape check
      says so.
    - **Any other method, with a form body** (``application/x-www-form-urlencoded``
      or ``multipart/form-data``): the fields, which are flat. Django parses
      one into ``request.POST`` for POST alone, so a PUT, PATCH or DELETE
      body is parsed here the same way rather than arriving empty. Any other
      body is refused as
      [`UnsupportedMediaType`][django_service_specs.http.unsupported_media_type.UnsupportedMediaType]
      rather than read as none, since an operation whose parameters are all
      optional would then run with nothing; a request with no body carries no
      arguments, whatever its ``Content-Type`` says.

    **A flat source** is read by the declaration. A parameter of type
    ``array`` takes every value its key was sent with, and anything else takes
    the last, as ``QueryDict`` reads a repeated key. **A blank value is
    absent unless** ``""`` **is one the parameter can take**: a plain string
    can, and a number, a boolean, a date, a decimal, or a string whose
    choices leave the blank out cannot. A flat wire has no other spelling of
    "left blank", and an empty ``?count=`` or ``?since=`` from a filter form is
    not a refusal to count or a malformed date. Each blank element of an array
    is read by the same rule, the whole array absent once nothing is left. Django's
    ``csrfmiddlewaretoken`` is dropped. What remains goes through
    [`coerce_flat`][django_service_specs.parameters.coerce_flat.coerce_flat],
    which leaves an undeclared key as it is, so the closed argument set in
    dispatch stays the one place that refuses it, under the caller's policy.

    **Files are not arguments.** Parameters have no file type, so an upload in
    a multipart body is never one. A POST's uploads are in ``request.FILES``,
    which Django fills for POST alone: those in a PUT, PATCH or DELETE body
    parsed here are dropped.

    **URL kwargs are merged last**, through ``coerce_flat`` as well since a
    path segment with no converter is a string. The route wins a clash, as it
    does in djangorestframework-services: a client-supplied value must not
    move the route's scope, so ``/notes/4/`` with ``pk=9`` in its body is about
    note 4. On a flat request the two are coerced together, so every refusal
    comes back at once and a clashing client value the route replaced is
    never refused.

    Raises:
        InvalidArguments: a JSON body that does not parse or is not an object,
            under ``non_field_errors``; or ``coerce_flat``'s refusals, each at
            its parameter's name.
        UnsupportedMediaType: a body that is neither JSON nor a form.
        ImproperlyConfigured: a URL kwarg ``parameters`` does not declare,
            which is the host's route rather than the client's request; see
            ``route_arguments`` in this subpackage's ``utils``.
