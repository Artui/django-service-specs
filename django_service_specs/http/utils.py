"""What the HTTP entry points share: reading a request, answering a result, the view's half.

``dispatch_request`` and ``adispatch_request`` differ only in how they reach
the kernel, so everything either does to a request before dispatch and to a
result after it is written once here. The async one runs ``read_request`` in
an executor hop and builds its responses on the loop, which is why the two
halves are separate functions: the read may query, and the answer never does.

``SpecView`` and ``AsyncSpecView`` likewise differ only in their handlers, so
everything else about them is ``SpecViewBase``.

    Anonymous is passed through because a permission check is what decides

    A deactivated account is refused. ``ModelBackend`` never logs one in, but
    ``AllowAllUsersModelBackend`` and a project's own backend may, and the
    kernel's rule - the one ``resolve_principal`` enforces off HTTP - is that a
    deactivated principal never acts. ``AnonymousUser.is_active`` is ``False``,
    so the guard asks about authenticated users alone, and a custom user model
    with no ``is_active`` reads as active, as ``ModelBackend`` reads it.

    ``test_anonymous_reaches_the_permission_check`` (``is_authenticated``) and

    leaves there, which is a session query, so the async entry point calls this
