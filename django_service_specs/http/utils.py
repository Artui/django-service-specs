"""What the HTTP entry points share: the principal, the route, the answer, the view's half.

``dispatch_request`` and ``adispatch_request`` differ only in how they reach
the kernel, so everything either does to a request before dispatch and to a
result after it is written once here. The async one reads the request in an
executor hop and builds its responses on the loop, which is why the two
halves are separate functions: the read may query, and the answer never does.

Nothing here imports ``request_arguments``, which reads the route through
``route_arguments``: a shared helper that did would make the two import each
other.

``SpecView`` and ``AsyncSpecView`` likewise differ only in their handlers, so
everything else about them is ``SpecViewBase``.

    A deactivated account is refused, by the rule dispatch itself applies and

    asks about authenticated users alone, since ``AnonymousUser.is_active`` is
    ``False``, and a custom user model with no ``is_active`` reads as active.
    Dispatch would refuse the same user; refusing here as well is what keeps
    the request unread for one, as ``adispatch`` resolves a ``principal_id``
    before looking at its arguments.

    Touching ``request.user`` evaluates the lazy object AuthenticationMiddleware
    leaves there, which is a session query, so the async entry point calls this
