## [Unreleased]

### Added
- The kernel, whole. An operation is declared once as a `ServiceSpec` (a write)
  or a `SelectorSpec` (a read), and `dispatch()` runs it from any transport in a
  fixed order: the shape check and the closed argument set, class-level
  authorization, target resolution, object-level authorization, validation with
  the resolved row in the Validator's context, the run, and the output
  selector. `adispatch()` does the same with one executor hop for the whole
  prelude; only the run may be `async def`.
- A missing row is **reported**, as `DispatchResult(kind="not_found")`, never
  raised, so each transport answers it in its own terms. `present()` refuses to
  render one as a success.
- `Parameter` and `Parameters`: what an operation takes, as JSON types with
  formats, choices, nullability, and nesting for an object's fields or an
  array's rows. `check_arguments()` refuses every problem in one
  `InvalidArguments` tree, at every level: `{"books": {1: {"title": [...]}}}`,
  with a row's own message under `non_field_errors`, as Django and DRF place
  it. `coerce_flat()` reads argv-shaped strings into what typed JSON gives, and
  refuses a nested parameter by name rather than guessing.
- `UnknownArguments.REJECT` by default: an argument nobody declared is refused
  at its own address. `IGNORE` drops it instead, at every level.
- `Validator` and `ValidationContext`, with `DataclassValidator` and
  `DataclassPresenter` as the reference adapters: plain dataclasses, nested
  ones and lists of them, `Decimal`, `datetime`, `date`, `Literal`, `Enum` and
  Django's `Choices`. With `USE_TZ` on, an offset-less date-time is made aware
  in the current time zone, as Django's forms do. `bind_arguments()` runs the
  shape check and the Validator for a transport that binds input itself.
- `PermissionCheck`, with `Unrestricted()` as the explicit allow. An operation
  that declares no permission check is refused at registration and at dispatch,
  because off HTTP there is no view whose policy it could inherit. A transport
  that has already authorized passes a `Grant`, bound by identity to one spec
  and one principal and refusing to be serialized, so it cannot cross a queue.
- `resolve_principal()` turns an identifier into a user who may act, and
  refuses a missing, malformed or deactivated one with `PrincipalUnavailable`.
  Never an anonymous user.
- Two error families that say who refused. `DispatchError` (`InvalidArguments`,
  `NotPermitted`, `PrincipalUnavailable`) is dispatch refusing before the
  operation ran; `ServiceError` (`ServiceValidationError`, `ServiceConflict`,
  `ServiceNotFound`) is the operation refusing. Neither subclasses the other.
- `Output`, `OutputField`, `FieldMarking` and `FieldAudience`: what an
  operation returns, declared beside what it takes, with a marking for each
  field's audience.
- `PoolSeeds`: a project's own values in every dispatched callable's keyword
  pool, such as a tenant or a clock. A seed's name is reserved, so a spec
  declaring an argument by that name is refused rather than left to meet the
  seed in one pool.
- Relation writes: `ChildSpec`, `ForwardRelationSpec`, `ReverseOneToOneSpec`,
  `ManyToManySpec` and `GenericRelationSpec`, applied by `create_from_input()`,
  `update_from_input()`, `apply_input()` and their async forms, with a
  `ChangeResult` describing what changed. A row's refusal, a
  `ServiceValidationError` or an `InvalidArguments`, is re-rooted under its own
  address and keeps its class, and Django's own write failures on a row become
  `InvalidArguments` there. Any other error raised by a row service, a `scope`
  or an `m2m` callable passes through untouched, at any depth, and so does an
  `IntegrityError`.
- `SpecRegistry`: a named, taggable set of specs for a project exposing
  operations over more than one transport.
